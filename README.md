# KU-Zombie-Invasion

Kathmandu University is under a Zombie attack! Survive the apocalypse and claim your classrooms back!

Bullets are important resources. Time is critical. [Double tap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4sWxsrEFFs&ab_channel=ALTERIAN%2CINC.) whenever possible. Shoot and kill all zombies in the classroom to overcome the invasion, save your university and [~~don't~~ be a hero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3yaZ-pjR2M&ab_channel=An01dGr4ndma).
